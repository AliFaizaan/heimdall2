# Heimdall Enterprise Server 2.0

This repository contains the source code for the Heimdall 2 Backend and Frontend (Heimdall-Lite).

## How to Install

This project uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) (multi-project manager) to manage dependencies and run the applications. Installing dependencies can be done by running

    npm install -g lerna
    npx lerna bootstrap --hoist

## How to Run

#### Heimdall Server + Frontend Development

In order to run Heimdall Server, Postgresql must be installed and the following one-time steps must be performed:

    cp apps/backend/.env-example apps/backend/.env
    # Edit /apps/backend/.env to reflect the appropriate configuration for your system
    npx lerna exec "npx sequelize-cli db:create" --scope heimdall-server
    npx lerna exec "npx sequelize-cli db:migrate" --scope heimdall-server

Once the above steps are completed it is possible to start heimdall-server using the following command

    npm run start:dev

#### Heimdall Lite Standalone

    npm run lite:dev


### Run With Docker

Given that Heimdall requires at least a database service, we use Docker Compose.

#### Setup Docker Container (Clean Install)

1. Install Docker
2. Download heimdall by running `git clone https://github.com/mitre/heimdall2.git`.
3. Navigate to the base folder where `docker-compose.yml` is located
4. Run the following commands in a terminal window from the heimdall source directory:
   1. `./setup-docker-secrets.sh`
   2. `docker-compose up -d`
6. Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

#### Running Docker Container

Make sure you have run the setup steps at least once before following these steps!

1. Run the following command in a terminal window:
   - `docker-compose up -d`
2. Go to `127.0.0.1:3000` in a web browser

##### Updating Docker Container

A new version of the docker container can be retrieved by running:

```
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

This will fetch the latest version of the container, redeploy if a newer version exists, and then apply any database migrations if applicable. No data should be lost by this operation.

##### Stopping the Container

`docker-compose down` # From the source directory you started from
